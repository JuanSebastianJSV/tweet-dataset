Since CO2 must rise to 1,071 ppm to even reach a forcing of only 0.5 W/m² at the ocean surface (i.e., 18x smaller than the cloud impact in LW), CO2 cannot drive ocean heat changes. https://t.co/eHlQ0SB60L",,,,

Since the total greenhouse effect forcing was flat/negative (-0.04 W/m²/yr) from 1992-2014 and the shortwave forcing was positive (+3 W/m²) from the 1980s to present, we can deduce what's driven ocean warming. https://t.co/7P7sHoTacB",,,,
